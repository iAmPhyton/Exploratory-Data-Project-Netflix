Netflix Content Analysis & Machine Learning Project
Overview:
This project examines the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset, involving data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning to identify content trends and predict content types. The study aims to uncover insights such as content growth over time, genre distribution, and factors influencing whether a title is a Movie or TV Show.

Project Objectives:
Data Cleaning — Handle missing values, parse dates, and standardize duration formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Visualize trends such as content growth by year, ratings, and country distribution.
Feature Engineering — Extract key features from date and text fields (e.g., release year, duration, and type).
Machine Learning Model — Train a classification model to predict whether a title is a Movie or a TV Show.

Visualization — Used Plotly for a rich, interactive dashboard and confusion matrix visualization with performance metrics.
